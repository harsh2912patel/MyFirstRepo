## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted, sophisticated blue (#5DADE2) to convey trust and stability, which are relevant to the topic of personal finance. Avoids cliche choices like green, as well as overly bold colors that would not suit the serious, detailed content of this app.
- Background color: A very light gray (#F5F7FA), nearly white, of the same hue as the primary. Supports the primary color without overpowering it.
- Accent color: A soft, contrasting coral (#F08080) for important calls to action and visual cues. It draws attention without being jarring, creating an easy-to-use interface.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for clear readability and a modern, neutral feel throughout the app. Aims for clarity and avoids distracting styling.
- Use a consistent set of minimalistic line icons to represent categories (e.g., expenses, loans, investments). Simple and easily recognizable.
- Maintain a clean, well-spaced layout to prevent visual clutter. Utilize a grid system for aligning elements and creating a sense of order. Emphasize a data-driven design, focused on information clarity, over decorative elements.
- Subtle transitions for page navigation and data updates to provide gentle feedback and maintain user engagement. Focused on usability rather than excessive flourish.
